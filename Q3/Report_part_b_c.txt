# Here since number of 'no' is greater than 'yes', the baseline will be that outdoorSeating = False, this will give us a baseline zero-one error of yes/(yes+no) = 0.326, which is very high as compared to the bayes classifier

# Zero-One Loss tells just, if the test sample is correctly classified or not, Squared Loss indicates the closeness of the test sample with the correct label
